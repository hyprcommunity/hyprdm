## Features
- HOTP and TOTP support for user login, PAM, and 2FA.
- Customization based on Qt QuickShell patches or configurations.
- Thanks to the backend system, we now have **Rust** and **C++** support for developing graphical interfaces.
- **Theme Manager support:** Full support for GTK and Qt themes, including custom theme support.
- With **sessiondm**, you can use Hyprland Display Manager as a session-based login manager.
- Manage full window settings with the layout manager.

In short, we support many integrations and features that carry DM functionality, and we plan to offer more advanced security and integration support in the future.

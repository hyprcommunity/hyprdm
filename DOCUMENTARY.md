# HYPDM DOCUMENT

## About
Hyprdm, or **Hyprland Display Manager**, is managed by HyprCommunity and distributed by Azccriminal.  
Hyprdm is distributed under the **BSL license** and offers fully integrated support with Hyprland, while also adopting a minimalist and customizable architecture.  

Hyprdm offers various interfaces with various features, such as **Hyproman** and **Narval**, as the default interfaces, and provides the infrastructure and support for optional use of these interfaces.

---

## Installation
Hyprdm installation varies depending on the intended use. Hyprdm offers a fully customizable structure. Thanks to its backend system, it provides a layer where you can adapt the frontend structure to the backend with **QML** or different graphic libraries and interfaces. However, it optionally offers its own **greeterd service system** and support for a **QML-based interface engine**.  

### If using the RUST backend overlay ROB system:
```bash
cargo build --release
````

### If using the FFI backend interface:

```bash
HDM_API_LIB_TYPE=c cargo build --release --no-default-features
```

You can install the GUI API, the base Hyprdm API, by following these steps.

### If installing **Hyproman** and **Narval** interfaces:

You need to install the FFI backend and **Hyprdmgreeterd**.

#### Steps to install Hyprdmgreeterd:

```bash
cd gui-api/greeterd
bash autogen.sh
```

* **If compiling with Makefile:**

```bash
make
sudo make install
```

* **If compiling with CMakeLists.txt:**

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
```

These interfaces are officially supported by hyprcommunity, but you can install them optionally. Hyprdm's core philosophy is a **fully customizable display manager system**. With the backend, you can develop any interface you want and adapt it to the backend system.

## Usage

If you're going to use Hyprdm, or Hyprland as it's fully known, display manager, you should first understand the following:

1. While Hyprdm is based on Hyprland, it officially uses the **Smithway Wayland API** and runs on a **wlroot-based Rust backend**.
2. Hyprdm offers a fully customizable environment and provides the necessary interface support. You can build a Hyprdm-based interface by following the necessary documentation regarding interface configuration.
3. Hyprdm can work completely without Hyprland. Even if you encounter some integration issues, it's still possible to use it in any way.

---

## Interface Usage

While the interface is currently under development and may not offer many features, it does offer certain features.

The **Rust Overlay Backend (ROB)** system includes the following features:

* HOTP and TOTP support for user login, PAM, and 2FA.
* Customization based on Qt QuickShell patches or configurations.
* Rust and C++ support for developing graphical interfaces.
* Theme Manager Support: Full support for GTK and Qt themes, including custom theme support.
* Use the **Hyprland Screen Manager** as a session-based login manager with Sessiondm.
* Manage all window settings with the layout manager.

More advanced features will be added in the future.

## Build your own interface

You can build your own interface with the ROB system.

If you've followed the ROB compilation instructions, you can build your own interface using different graphical libraries and interfaces using QML or your own greeterd system and the ROB backend.

**Example interface instructions are posted on GitHub in QuickShell:**
[Hyproman QML example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyprcommunity/hyprdm/refs/heads/main/gui-api/quickshell/Hyproman/test/test.qml)

This example is a QML interface frontend. You can create your own GUI by connecting to the ROB backend in the same way as other GUIs.

If you're planning to build a **Greeterd-like interface rendering system** and are using an FFI backend, check out these examples:
[Greeterd backend header](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyprcommunity/hyprdm/refs/heads/main/gui-api/greeterd/backend/backend.h)

If you are not using the FFI backend, you can create an interface compatible with the backend system by following the **gui-api** and **hdm-api** codes in the source code:
[HDM API source](https://github.com/hyprcommunity/hyprdm/tree/main/gui-api/hdm_api)

`hdm_api` includes Hyprdm API configuration and other features developed in the same way.

## Commands and usage

* You can apply changes to the config with:

```bash
hyprdmconfigmanager --reload
```

If it's incorrect, it may give a warning and may not restart hyprdm via systemctl.

* Start the greeter:

```bash
hyprdmgreeterd
```

You can use **hyprdmgreeterd** via **systemctl**. It reads QML files directly from the:

```
~/.config/quickshell
.local/share/quickshell
```

directory.
